Farmer: Hello there, I've been meaning to ask, what are the current pesticide application record-keeping requirements for my state?

Agriculture Specialist: Good day! The requirements can vary, but generally, you must keep records for at least two years after the application. They should include information like the date of application, the target pest, the product name, EPA registration number, rate of application, and the area treated.

Farmer: I see. How can I ensure I am fully complying with them?

Agriculture Specialist: The best way is to maintain a detailed log for each pesticide application and regularly review your state's department of agriculture website for updates. They may have specific forms or software to help you keep these records up-to-date.

Farmer: That's helpful, thank you. Moving on, I want to make sure my Certified Crop Advisor certification is current. How often do I need to renew it?

Agriculture Specialist: Your CCA certification should be renewed every two years. You'll receive a renewal notice a few months before it's due, so keep an eye out for that.

Farmer: Alright, and what about the continuing education requirements?

Agriculture Specialist: To renew, you need to acquire a certain number of Continuing Education Units or CEUs. You need 40 CEUs every two years, with at least five in nutrient management, five in soil and water management, five in integrated pest management, and five in crop management. The remaining credits can be from any of those categories or from professional development.

Farmer: I appreciate the specifics. One last thing, are there any new conservation compliance provisions I should be aware of when participating in Federal farm programs?

Agriculture Specialist: Yes, there are. For example, the 2018 Farm Bill reinforced the need for farm compliance with Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation regulations. It's wise to consult with your local Natural Resources Conservation Service office to ensure you're meeting the current requirements. They can have significant impacts on your eligibility for many Federal farm programs.

Farmer: Thanks so much for your guidance. I'll get in touch with the NRCS office and make sure I'm on top of things.

Agriculture Specialist: You're welcome! It's always better to be proactive about these regulations. If you have any more questions down the road, don't hesitate to reach out.
