Farmer: Good afternoon! I've been reading about nitrogen application for my corn crops in a no-till system. I'm wondering, what's the recommended rate of nitrogen to apply?

Agriculture Specialist: Good afternoon! The nitrogen application rate can vary, but for a no-till system, you typically want to start with a base application rate of around 90 to 130 pounds per acre. However, this depends on your soil type, organic matter content, and yield goals.

Farmer: Thanks, that gives me a range to work with. Now, I have sandy soil, which seems to leach nutrients quickly. How should I adjust my phosphorus and potassium fertilizer strategy to account for that?

Agriculture Specialist: Sandy soils do indeed have a higher leaching potential. You'll want to apply phosphorus and potassium based on a soil test to avoid over- or under-application. Potassium is especially mobile in sandy soils, so it might be necessary to split the application, providing some at planting and some during the growing season.

Farmer: Understood. I do soil tests every year. For the split application, is there a specific stage of growth I should target for that second application?

Agriculture Specialist: For potassium, side-dressing at knee-high stage is a good practice for corn. For phosphorus, since it's less mobile, a pre-plant application based on your soil test recommendations should suffice unless your test indicates a severe deficiency.

Farmer: Along those same lines, can you provide some best practices for side-dressing fertilizer in my soybean field?

Agriculture Specialist: Absolutely. Side-dressing in soybeans can be beneficial if the crop shows signs of nutrient deficiency, usually around the R3 growth stage. At this point, the soybeans start pod formation and can use the extra nutrients. Be sure to apply side-dress nitrogen carefully to avoid leaf burn and crop injury.

Farmer: R3 stage, got it. Would you recommend a specific type of fertilizer for the side-dressing?

Agriculture Specialist: I'd suggest using a urea-based fertilizer or an anhydrous ammonia, as they are more concentrated and cost-effective. Just remember to use a stabilizer with the urea to minimize volatilization losses, and make sure the anhydrous is properly sealed into the soil to prevent loss of nitrogen as gas.

Farmer: Thanks for the tips! I'll make sure to incorporate these practices this season.
