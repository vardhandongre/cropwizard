Turn 2: Agriculture Specialist Dr. Green: Good morning, John. To minimize spoilage, you want to keep your grain storage at a temperature between 15-20°C and maintain the humidity level below 65%. This helps prevent the growth of mold and other pathogens. 

Explanation: This statement is inaccurate. The recommended temperature for most stored grains is around 0°C (32°F) during winter storage to slow down the biological processes that lead to spoilage, not 15-20°C[4](https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/GQ/GQ-6.pdf). The recommended relative humidity is also typically much higher than 65% to prevent moisture loss and quality degradation. For example, most vegetables are recommended to be stored at a relative humidity level of 95%[1](https://extension.psu.edu/the-seven-deadly-sins-that-impact-produce-quality).

Correct Information: To minimize spoilage, you want to keep your grain storage at a temperature close to 0°C (32°F) and maintain a high humidity level, often around 95% for vegetables, depending on the specific crop.

Turn 6: Dr. Green: The key is to maintain cleanliness and secure the storage area to prevent entry. Use hermetic storage solutions when possible. Natural deterrents like neem oil can also be effective. Regular inspections are crucial to catch any infestations early.

Explanation: While Dr. Green's advice is generally good, it's important to note that it may not be feasible or effective to use neem oil on all types of pests or in all storage conditions. It's better to first identify the specific pests you're dealing with and then choose the most effective control method for those pests.

Turn 8: Dr. Green: Certainly, John. Extreme temperature and humidity can lower the viability of seeds. It's crucial to store them in conditions similar to grains to preserve their germination capacity.

Explanation: This statement is only partly correct. While it's true that extreme temperature and humidity can lower the viability of seeds, it's not always best to store seeds under the same conditions as grains. Seed storage conditions can vary greatly depending on the type of seed, with some seeds requiring specific temperatures or humidity levels to maintain viability.

Turn 12: Dr. Green: To retard ripening and extend storage life, you typically want to maintain oxygen levels at about 2-5% and carbon dioxide levels at 1-3% for apples in controlled atmosphere storage. But be sure to research and adjust these levels based on the specific apple varieties you're storing.

Explanation: This statement is inaccurate. While the concept of using controlled atmosphere storage for apples is correct, the specific levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide provided are incorrect. Typically, oxygen levels are maintained at around 2-3% and carbon dioxide levels at around 1-2.5%[3](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a6b36f28fd4d259ba4fae16/t/5a7e00cc71c10b2ebf7df534/1518207192816/Wholesale-Success-Manual.pdf).

Correct Information: To retard ripening and extend storage life, you typically want to maintain oxygen levels at about 2-3% and carbon dioxide levels at 1-2.5% for apples in controlled atmosphere storage. But be sure to research and adjust these levels based on the specific apple varieties you're storing.
