1. Farmer's question about frost protection: Accurate.
2. Agriculture Specialist's advice on frost protection: Accurate. Frost blankets and row covers are commonly used methods for frost protection, and the suggestion to keep plants well-hydrated is also correct ([Source](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/frost_protection_for_the_garden)).
3. Farmer's question about watering before frost: Accurate.
4. Agriculture Specialist's advice on watering before frost: Accurate. Watering before a frost night can help protect plants, as wet soil retains more heat than dry soil ([Source](https://www.almanac.com/protecting-your-garden-frost)).
5. Farmer's question about adjusting planting schedule: Accurate.
6. Agriculture Specialist's advice on adjusting planting schedule: Accurate. Tracking local frost dates and monitoring weather predictions are good practices for optimizing planting schedules.

7. Farmer's question about current planting: Accurate.
8. Agriculture Specialist's advice on current planting: Accurate. Using cold frames or heated tunnels, and succession planting, are valid strategies for dealing with unpredictable weather ([Source](https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/ho/ho-186-w.pdf)).
9. Farmer's question about irrigation strategies during drought: Accurate.
10. Agriculture Specialist's advice on irrigation strategies during drought: Accurate. Drip irrigation and mulching are both effective strategies for conserving water during drought conditions, and scheduling irrigation early in the morning or late in the evening can indeed help reduce water loss due to evaporation ([Source](https://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/drip-irrigation-conserves-water-reduces-disease)).
11. Farmer's question about mulching: Accurate.
12. Agriculture Specialist's advice on mulching: Accurate. Organic mulches can help retain moisture and enrich the soil over time. The advice to apply a 2-3 inch layer and avoid piling it directly against plant stems is also correct to prevent rot ([Source](https://extension.umn.edu/how/how-apply-mulch)).
