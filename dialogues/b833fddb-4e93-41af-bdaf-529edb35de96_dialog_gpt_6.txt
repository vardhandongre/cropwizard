Farmer: Hi there. I was hoping you could help me with a crop rotation strategy for my field. I've had a bit of an issue with soybean cyst nematode (SCN) lately.

Agriculture Specialist: Certainly, I can help with that. The best approach to manage SCN is to rotate your soybeans with non-host crops. A good strategy might be to rotate your soybeans with corn or wheat, which SCN cannot infest.

Farmer: So if I switch over to corn or wheat for a season, that should help decrease the nematode population?

Agriculture Specialist: Exactly. It's not a one-time fix though. You'll need to follow a multi-year rotation and integrate non-host crops. Also consider resistant soybean varieties when you do plant soybeans again.

Farmer: Thanks for the advice. While we're on the topic of corn, I've also noticed my cornfield has low nitrogen levels and the pH is quite high. Any suggestions on a fertilization plan?

Agriculture Specialist: To correct low nitrogen levels, you could start with a soil test to determine the exact levels. Then, you can apply a starter fertilizer at planting and side-dress with nitrogen-based fertilizer when the corn is knee-high. You also might want to use a nitrogen stabilizer to minimize leaching, especially since your pH is high.

Farmer: Got it, and the high pH issue?

Agriculture Specialist: With high pH soils, the availability of micro nutrients like zinc, iron, and manganese to the plants can be limited. You can correct for this by applying chelated micro nutrient fertilizers or sulfur to lower the pH slightly.

Farmer: Okay, that makes sense. Lastly, I have another field with sandy loam soil thatâ€™s prone to erosion. What cover crop options would be best to improve soil health and prevent erosion?

Agriculture Specialist: Cover crops like cereal rye or oats are great for sandy loam soils as they have fibrous root systems that hold soil in place and improve soil structure. Other good choices to prevent erosion and also improve soil health are radishes and clover, which can break up compacted layers and fix nitrogen, respectively.

Farmer: So, if I plant cereal rye after harvesting in the fall, will that be enough time for it to establish before winter?

Agriculture Specialist: Yes, if you plant it early enough after harvest, cereal rye establishes quickly and can provide good soil coverage to protect against erosion over the winter months. It's also cold-tolerant, which is ideal for overwintering.
